# Trading system

## Description

This project simulates an electronic trading market in which  clients can **buy** or **sell** equity. The system will not only match orders but also output transaction information specified by some command line arguments. For detailed descriptions and usages, please refer to .

## Sample IO

Two small samples are provided to show how the trading system works. By executing `./main -v < sample/sample_.in`, you can obtain the sample output.
The verbose sample outputs are stored in `sample0_verbose.out` and `sample1_verbose.out` respectively.
